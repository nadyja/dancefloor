# Canvas API dancefloor

Solution for the challenge.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>


## Task 
The main goal of the task is to create a interactive dance floor based on CanvasAPI.
The approach to achieve the task is free. We want to see how you solve problems and some basic algorithmic skills.

You can use all available resources and libs to achive the task.
You can choose the way how you want to interact with the canvas. 

Basic UI mockup: 
![Example](examples/canvas_api_dancefloor.png)

## Requirements:

The flow of app initialization and view rendering should be as follow: 
    -> App bootstraping 
      -> Async operation to fetch the state (eg. You can simulate API call to recreate canvas with config) 
        -> UI and Canvas 
  
## Examples addons:

  - Change square colours on document event like mouseover or onclick
  - Prepare simple API to recreate canvas based on provided config (rows and columns quantity)
  - You can prepare transform animation
  - You can combine all of previous examples
  - What you want but first ask! :)
 
 GOOD LUCK! :)
